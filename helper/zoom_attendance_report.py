TODO

Need to figure out some logic around parsing groupings of students, regardless
of the meeting topic. Consider health teachers' use case: they have one zoom
meet for a whole grade level, but only meet with certain students at a time.
They want to know what the attendance rate was for Mrs. Geltzeiler's homeroom;
they don't care about grouping scholars by meet topic like I do.

The best thing to do will probably be to look at the actual group of students
that is a part of any given meeting. Then, check the size of the union between
this meeting, and the other meetings that have been recorded so far. If there
is a large union, we can presume that this meeting is another instance of the
group from before.
