class MeetingSet:
    """

    # General Usage

    A directory full of meeting reports can be carelessly tossed into
    __init__. This class dynamically groups meetings by attendees. For example,
    if you use the same meeting topic (i.e. "Health") to meet with different
    groups of homerooms throughout the week, this class will observe the union
    of the set of attendees at each meeting instance, and if there is a
    significant intersection, those meetings are grouped.

    # Resultant Data Structure

    By default, meeting groupings will be accessible as a list (self.groups).
    Each item in the list will itself be a chronologically sorted list of
    Meeting instances. However, group_map may be passed to __init__ to produce
    a more descriptive data structure.

    # group_map: dict

    The presumption is that there is no reliable way to know the full name of
    a meeting. For example, the meeting topic might be, "Health," but whoose
    homeroom is it? There's no way to know from here. group_map is a mapping
    of filenames to correct, fully-descriptive meeting names. An example
    group_map might look like:

    {
        '6th Grade Health 9-24-2020 10:13 am.csv': 'Health; Mrs. Smith's Homeroom',
        'Garbled zoom report filename': 'A Group Label Useful to You'
    }

    You only provide a single association for a REAL group that actually meets
    together. Every time this class sees that same group (or nearly that same
    group) together again, it will be able to apply the label you've provided.
    Now, you have **cls.group_dict['A Group Label Useful to You']**. This
    returns a chronologically sorted list of Meeting instances of that group
    only.

    # trust_filenames: bool

    As I mentioned before, the presumption is that there is no reliable way to
    know the full name of a meeting. Often, teachers' meeting "topics," don't
    directly correspond to the names of the groups they are meeting with.
    If the meeting names are trustworthy, however, the group name will be the
    same as the meeting topic, and the same group_dict attribute as above will
    exist.
